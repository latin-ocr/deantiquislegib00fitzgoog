cmmcil that he should go himself ιο the said Harl, ιο Richard de la Vache,

precept. Moreover‚ when certain servants of the said Robert had been
taken in the liberties of william de Briouze and of the Bishop of Chichester,
together with the dogs of the said Robert, and imprisoned in the Castle of
Lewes, whereupon the King’s brief was obtained for their deliverunce, and
asterwards sent to the said castle by William le Boghyeoe, the King’s ser-
jennt, they of the castle had not permitted the said mandate of the lord the
King ιο be exeeuoed, but had absolutely contemned the order to do εο, so
that the Sheriff in his own proper person was with difficulty able to execute
the King’s said mandate. The jux-ors of the hundred of Bottynghull found
by their verdict that John de Boun and the bailiffs of the Earl of Surrey
had pnrsued the men of Robert Aguylon with horses and arms as far ns ιο
the house of Robert Burnell in Henfiekl, and there took them and led them
ιο the Castle of Lewes and imprisoned them, against the dignity of the
Crem until they were set free by the King’s writ.” A similar finding
