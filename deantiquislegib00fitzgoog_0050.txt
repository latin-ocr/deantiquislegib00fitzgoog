might be in office at the time, could plead a plen of this sort in his county
by brief or without brief as she chose, at the complaint of any one os her
tenants of the manor aforesaid, and says that she and her ancestors ftom
the time of King Richard, cousin of the King that now is, were aecustomed
to plmd a plea of this sort in the form aforesaid, and of this she puts her-
self upon the country. And william de Gisselham‚ who follows on the
King's behalf, in like manner. VVherefore an inquiry was made, of which
the jurors say upon their oath that Robert Aguyllon and Margaret his
wife, who hold the aforesaid manor in dower of her the said Margaret, of
the inhcritance of the aforesaid Countess, pleaded a plea of unjust caption
and detention of cattle in their court at the complaint of any of their tenants
of the manor aforesaid. And that Baldwin of the Isle, brother of the
aforesaid Countess‚ whose heir she is, pleaded a plea of this sort in the
aforesaid manor the whole time of his tenure. And they say that Baldwin,
father of the aforesaid Countess, was the first who pleaded a pica of this
sort in the aforesaid manor, and that plea was an eucroachment upon the

the same lord Hem-y the King. And because the aforesaid Countess

proved that Baldwin of the isle, father of the aforesaid Countess, had been
the first who pleaded that plea in the manor aforesaid, and that it was

an encroachment upon the lord Henry the King, father of the lord the
King that now is, therefore the crown had judginent.
